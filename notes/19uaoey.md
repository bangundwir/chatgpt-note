To web scrape the website [https://www.tokopedia.com/](https://www.tokopedia.com/) using Python and BeautifulSoup, you will first need to install both libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```python
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Then you will need to import the necessary libraries and modules:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

Next, you will need to send a GET request to the website and parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup:

```python
url = "https://www.tokopedia.com/"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")
```

Finally, you can use the methods provided by BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract the information you need from the HTML.

```python
# Extract all the links on the page
for link in soup.find_all("a"):
    print(link.get("href"))
```

This is just a basic example and you will need to modify it to scrape the specific data you need. You should also consider the website's `robots.txt` and make sure you are not breaking any terms of service.

wirte code in one file

!

Here is an example of a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the website [https://www.tokopedia.com/](https://www.tokopedia.com/) and extract all the links on the page:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Send GET request to website
url = "https://www.tokopedia.com/"
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

# Extract all the links on the page
for link in soup.find_all("a"):
    print(link.get("href"))
```

You can run this script by saving the code in a file with a .py extension and then running the file using the command line.

Please note that you should also consider the website's `robots.txt` and make sure you are not breaking any terms of service. Also, it's a good practice to add some delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server.

export to csv

To export the extracted data to a CSV file, you can use the `csv` module in Python. Here's an example of how you can modify the previous script to write the extracted links to a CSV file:

```python
import requests
import csv
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Send GET request to website
url = "https://buildwithangga.com/"
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

# Extract all the links on the page
links = []
for link in soup.find_all("a"):
    links.append(link.get("href"))

# Write links to CSV file
with open("links.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Links"])
    for l in links:
        writer.writerow([l])
```

This will write the links to a file called `links.csv` in the same directory as the script. You can also add a header row to csv file with the name of the column, in this case it is "Links" You should also consider the website's `robots.txt` and make sure you are not breaking any terms of service. Also, it's a good practice to add some delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server.
