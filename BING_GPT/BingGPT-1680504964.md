> **Cara mengatasi ini ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pywin32==227; sys\_platform == "win32" (from docker) (from versions: 302, 303, 304, 305, 306) ERROR: No matching distribution found for pywin32==227; sys\_platform == "win32"**

The error message indicates that you are trying to install a version of pywin32 that is not compatible with your Python version or platform. According to the web search results[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61359430/cannot-install-python-jupyter-or-jupyterlabs-on-windows-due-to-missing-pywin32), you may try the following steps:

*   Downgrade your Python version to 3.7.6 or lower, or
*   Force pip to install pywin32==225, which may work for Python 3.8 or 3.9, or
*   Upgrade your pip version and try again.

I hope this helps.ðŸ˜Š
